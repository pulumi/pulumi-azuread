/**
 * Gets information about an existing service principal associated with an application within Azure Active Directory.
 *
 * ## API Permissions
 *
 * The following API permissions are required in order to use this data source.
 *
 * When authenticated with a service principal, this data source requires one of the following application roles: `Application.Read.All` or `Directory.Read.All`
 *
 * When authenticated with a user principal, this data source does not require any additional roles.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * *Look up by application display name*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const example = azuread.getServicePrincipal({
 *     displayName: "my-awesome-application",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * *Look up by client ID*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const example = azuread.getServicePrincipal({
 *     clientId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * *Look up by service principal object ID*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const example = azuread.getServicePrincipal({
 *     objectId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
 * });
 * ```
