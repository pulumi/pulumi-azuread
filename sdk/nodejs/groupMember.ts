/**
 * Manages a single group membership within Azure Active Directory.
 *
 * > **Warning** Do not use this resource at the same time as the `members` property of the `azuread.Group` resource for the same group. Doing so will cause a conflict and group members will be removed.
 *
 * ## API Permissions
 *
 * The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.
 *
 * When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires one of the following application roles: `Group.ReadWrite.All` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`
 *
 * When authenticated with a user principal, this resource requires one of the following directory roles: `Groups Administrator`, `User Administrator` or `Global Administrator`
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const exampleUser = azuread.getUser({
 *     userPrincipalName: "jdoe@hashicorp.com",
 * });
 * const exampleGroup = new azuread.Group("exampleGroup", {
 *     displayName: "my_group",
 *     securityEnabled: true,
 * });
 * const exampleGroupMember = new azuread.GroupMember("exampleGroupMember", {
 *     groupObjectId: exampleGroup.id,
 *     memberObjectId: exampleUser.then(exampleUser => exampleUser.id),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Group members can be imported using the object ID of the group and the object ID of the member, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import azuread:index/groupMember:GroupMember test 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/member/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
 * ```
 *
 *  -> This ID format is unique to Terraform and is composed of the Azure AD Group Object ID and the target Member Object ID in the format `{GroupObjectID}/member/{MemberObjectID}`.
