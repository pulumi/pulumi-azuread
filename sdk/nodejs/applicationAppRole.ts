/**
 * Manages an app role for an application registration.
 *
 * This resource is analogous to the `appRole` block in the `azuread.Application` resource. When using these resources together, you should use the `ignoreChanges` lifecycle meta-argument (see example below).
 *
 * ## API Permissions
 *
 * The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.
 *
 * When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires one of the following application roles: `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` or `Application.ReadWrite.All`
 *
 * > When using the `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` application role, the principal being used to run Terraform must be an owner of the application.
 *
 * When authenticated with a user principal, this resource may require one of the following directory roles: `Application Administrator` or `Global Administrator`
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 * import * as random from "@pulumi/random";
 *
 * const example = new azuread.ApplicationRegistration("example", {displayName: "example"});
 * const exampleAdministrator = new random.index.Uuid("example_administrator", {});
 * const exampleAdminister = new azuread.ApplicationAppRole("example_administer", {
 *     applicationId: example.id,
 *     roleId: exampleAdministrator.id,
 *     allowedMemberTypes: ["User"],
 *     description: "My role description",
 *     displayName: "Administer",
 *     value: "admin",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * > **Tip** For managing more app roles, create additional instances of this resource
 *
 * *Usage with azuread.Application resource*
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const example = new azuread.Application("example", {displayName: "example"});
 * const exampleAdminister = new azuread.ApplicationAppRole("example_administer", {applicationId: example.id});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Application App Roles can be imported using the object ID of the application and the ID of the app role, in the following format.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import azuread:index/applicationAppRole:ApplicationAppRole example /applications/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/appRoles/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
 * ```
