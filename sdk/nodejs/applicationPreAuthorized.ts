/**
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const authorized = new azuread.ApplicationRegistration("authorized", {displayName: "example-authorized-app"});
 * const authorizer = new azuread.Application("authorizer", {
 *     displayName: "example-authorizing-app",
 *     api: {
 *         oauth2PermissionScopes: [
 *             {
 *                 adminConsentDescription: "Administer the application",
 *                 adminConsentDisplayName: "Administer",
 *                 enabled: true,
 *                 id: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
 *                 type: "Admin",
 *                 value: "administer",
 *             },
 *             {
 *                 adminConsentDescription: "Access the application",
 *                 adminConsentDisplayName: "Access",
 *                 enabled: true,
 *                 id: "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
 *                 type: "User",
 *                 userConsentDescription: "Access the application",
 *                 userConsentDisplayName: "Access",
 *                 value: "user_impersonation",
 *             },
 *         ],
 *     },
 * });
 * const example = new azuread.ApplicationPreAuthorized("example", {
 *     applicationId: authorizer.id,
 *     authorizedClientId: authorized.clientId,
 *     permissionIds: [
 *         "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
 *         "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
 *     ],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Pre-authorized applications can be imported using the object ID of the authorizing application and the application ID of the application being authorized, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import azuread:index/applicationPreAuthorized:ApplicationPreAuthorized example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/preAuthorizedApplication/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
 * ```
 *
 *  -> This ID format is unique to Terraform and is composed of the authorizing application's object ID, the string "preAuthorizedApplication" and the authorized application's application ID (client ID) in the format `{ObjectId}/preAuthorizedApplication/{ApplicationId}`.
