    /// Manages an app role for an application registration.
    /// 
    /// This resource is analogous to the `AppRole` block in the `azuread.Application` resource. When using these resources together, you should use the `IgnoreChanges` lifecycle meta-argument (see example below).
    /// 
    /// ## API Permissions
    /// 
    /// The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.
    /// 
    /// When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires one of the following application roles: `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` or `Application.ReadWrite.All`
    /// 
    /// &gt; When using the `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` application role, the principal being used to run Terraform must be an owner of the application.
    /// 
    /// When authenticated with a user principal, this resource may require one of the following directory roles: `Application Administrator` or `Global Administrator`
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using AzureAD = Pulumi.AzureAD;
    /// using Random = Pulumi.Random;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var example = new AzureAD.ApplicationRegistration("example", new()
    ///     {
    ///         DisplayName = "example",
    ///     });
    /// 
    ///     var exampleAdministrator = new Random.Index.Uuid("example_administrator");
    /// 
    ///     var exampleAdminister = new AzureAD.ApplicationAppRole("example_administer", new()
    ///     {
    ///         ApplicationId = example.Id,
    ///         RoleId = exampleAdministrator.Id,
    ///         AllowedMemberTypes = new[]
    ///         {
    ///             "User",

    ///         Value = "admin",
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
