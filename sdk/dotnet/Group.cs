    /// ## API Permissions
    /// 
    /// The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.
    /// 
    /// When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires one of the following application roles: `Group.ReadWrite.All` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`.
    /// 
    /// Alternatively, if the authenticated service principal is also an owner of the group being managed, this resource can use the application role: `Group.Create`.
    /// 
    /// If using the `assignable_to_role` property, this resource additionally requires the `RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory` application role.
    /// 
    /// If specifying owners for a group, which are user principals, this resource additionally requires one of the following application roles: `User.Read.All`, `User.ReadWrite.All`, `Directory.Read.All` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`
    /// 
    /// When authenticated with a user principal, this resource requires one of the following directory roles: `Groups Administrator`, `User Administrator` or `Global Administrator`
    /// 
    /// When creating this resource in administrative units exclusively, the role `Groups Administrator` is required to be scoped on any administrative unit used.
    /// 
    /// The `external_senders_allowed`, `auto_subscribe_new_members`, `hide_from_address_lists` and `hide_from_outlook_clients` properties can only be configured when authenticating as a user and cannot be configured when authenticating as a service principal. Additionally, the user being used for authentication must be a Member of the tenant where the group is being managed and _not_ a Guest. This is a known API issue; please see the [Microsoft Graph Known Issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues#groups) official documentation.
