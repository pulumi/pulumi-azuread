    /// Manages a single group membership within Azure Active Directory.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **Warning** Do not use this resource at the same time as the `members` property of the `azuread.Group` resource for the same group. Doing so will cause a conflict and group members will be removed.
    /// 
    /// ## API Permissions
    /// 
    /// The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.

    /// When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires one of the following application roles: `Group.ReadWrite.All` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`.
    /// 
    /// However, if the authenticated service principal is an owner of the group being managed, an application role is not required.

    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using AzureAD = Pulumi.AzureAD;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var example = AzureAD.GetUser.Invoke(new()
    ///     {
    ///         UserPrincipalName = "jdoe@example.com",

    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Group members can be imported using the object ID of the group and the object ID of the member, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import azuread:index/groupMember:GroupMember example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/member/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
