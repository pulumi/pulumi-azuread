        ## API Permissions

        The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.

        When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires one of the following application roles: `RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`

        When authenticated with a user principal, this resource requires one of the following directory roles: `Privileged Role Administrator` or `Global Administrator`

        ## Example Usage

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_azuread as azuread

        example = azuread.get_user(user_principal_name="jdoe@example.com")

            role_object_id=example_directory_role.object_id,
            member_object_id=example.object_id)
        ```

        ## Import

        Directory role members can be imported using the object ID of the role and the object ID of the member, e.g.

        ```sh
        $ pulumi import azuread:index/directoryRoleMember:DirectoryRoleMember example 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/member/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
        ```

        -> This ID format is unique to Terraform and is composed of the Directory Role Object ID and the target Member Object ID in the format `{RoleObjectID}/member/{MemberObjectID}`.
