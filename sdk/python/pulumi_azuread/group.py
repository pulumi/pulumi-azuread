        Manages a Group within Azure Active Directory.

        > **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to `Read and write all groups` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API. In addition it must also have either the `Company Administrator` or `User Account Administrator` Azure Active Directory roles assigned in order to be able to delete groups. You can assign one of the required Azure Active Directory Roles with the **AzureAD PowerShell Module**, which is available for Windows PowerShell or in the Azure Cloud Shell. Please refer to [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azuread/add-azureaddirectoryrolemember) for more details.

        ## Example Usage



        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_azuread as azuread

        example = azuread.Group("example")
        ```
