        > **Warning** Do not use this resource at the same time as the `members` property of the `Group` resource for the same group. Doing so will cause a conflict and group members will be removed.

        ## API Permissions

        The following API permissions are required in order to use this resource.

        When authenticated with a service principal, this resource requires one of the following application roles: `Group.ReadWrite.All` or `Directory.ReadWrite.All`

        When authenticated with a user principal, this resource requires one of the following directory roles: `Groups Administrator`, `User Administrator` or `Global Administrator`

        ## Example Usage

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_azuread as azuread

        example_user = azuread.get_user(user_principal_name="jdoe@hashicorp.com")

            member_object_id=example_user.id)
        ```

        ## Import

        Group members can be imported using the object ID of the group and the object ID of the member, e.g.

        ```sh
         $ pulumi import azuread:index/groupMember:GroupMember test 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/member/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
